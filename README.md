# Developing a People Management System in REST API with Spring (Java)

## Introduction

Welcome to the People Management System, a REST API project developed using the Spring framework in Java. This project aims to provide a solution for managing people records, including their personal information, such as name, age, and contact details.

## Features

- **RESTful API:** The application follows the principles of a RESTful architecture, allowing clients to interact with the system using standard HTTP methods.
- **Data Persistence:** The system utilizes a relational database for storing and retrieving people records.
- **CRUD Operations:** The API supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing people records.
- **Validation:** Input data is validated to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- **Exception Handling:** The API handles exceptions and provides appropriate error responses.
- **Security:** Appropriate security measures, such as authentication and authorization, can be implemented to secure the API endpoints.
- **Testing:** Unit tests are included to verify the functionality of the API endpoints.
- **Documentation:** Clear and concise API documentation is provided for developers to understand and consume the API.

## Technology Stack

The People Management System is built using the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Java**: A widely-used programming language for building enterprise-level applications.
- **Spring Boot**: A framework that simplifies the development of Java applications, providing a robust and scalable foundation.
- **Spring MVC**: A module of the Spring framework that supports building web applications using the Model-View-Controller pattern.
- **Spring Data JPA**: A module that provides convenient data access and persistence capabilities using the Java Persistence API (JPA).
- **H2 Database**: A lightweight, in-memory database for easy development and testing.
- **JUnit**: A popular testing framework for Java applications.
